                  <span>This proposal is informed by two items of sectoral legislation addressing the area of child sexual abuse.  The first is Directive 2011/93/EU on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and more recently Regulation 2021/1232/EU on a temporary derogation from certain provisions of Directive 2002/58/EC as regards the use of technologies by providers of number-independent interpersonal communications services for the processing of personal and other data for the purpose of combating online child sexual abuse.</span>

                  <span>The 2011 Directive, which then represented an important step forward, must be fully transposed by Member States as a matter of urgency.  The Commission will continue to use its enforcement powers under the Treaties through infringement procedures to ensure swift implementation. In parallel to this, and as indicated in the EU Strategy for a more effective fight against child sexual abuse, the Commission has initiated a study to prepare the evaluation of the 2011 Directive and its possible future revision. </span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The aim of Regulation 2021/1232/EU (the “Interim Regulation”) was to enable certain online communications services to continue the use technologies to detect and report child sexual abuse online and remove child sexual abuse material on their services.  It has a limited duration and narrow scope limited to voluntary activities of certain online services during an interim period of maximum 3 years, which will expire in August 2024.</span>

                  <span>This proposal is informed by two items of sectoral legislation addressing the area of child sexual abuse.  The first is Directive 2011/93/EU on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and more recently Regulation 2021/1232/EU on a temporary derogation from certain provisions of Directive 2002/58/EC as regards the use of technologies by providers of number-independent interpersonal communications services for the processing of personal and other data for the purpose of combating online child sexual abuse.</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The 2011 Directive, which then represented an important step forward, must be fully transposed by Member States as a matter of urgency.  The Commission will continue to use its enforcement powers under the Treaties through infringement procedures to ensure swift implementation. In parallel to this, and as indicated in the EU Strategy for a more effective fight against child sexual abuse, the Commission has initiated a study to prepare the evaluation of the 2011 Directive and its possible future revision. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The aim of Regulation 2021/1232/EU (the “Interim Regulation”) was to enable certain online communications services to continue the use technologies to detect and report child sexual abuse online and remove child sexual abuse material on their services.  It has a limited duration and narrow scope limited to voluntary activities of certain online services during an interim period of maximum 3 years, which will expire in August 2024.</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The current proposal builds on the 2011 Directive, in particular for the definition of child sexual abuse offences, and on the Interim Regulation, in particular on its safeguards for the detection of online child sexual abuse.</span>
